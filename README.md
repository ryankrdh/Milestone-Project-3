# Milestone-Project-3
This is a card game called "Blackjack" and it built with Python using Pycharm.

## What was your motivation?

My motivation was to improve my programming skills using OOP

## Why did you build this project?

To practice what I know and to try and impliment a player bank(score) system in a card game.

## How to use

Game will have only one player against a dealer.

Card rank are as follows:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack(10), Queen(10), King(10), Ace(1 or 11)

Player can either STAND or HIT. You are also able to determine the betting amount.

## Rules

At the start of a Blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each. The players' cards are normally dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down (called the hole card) and one face up. The best possible Blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card.

When playing Blackjack the numeral cards 2 to 10 have their face values, Jacks, Queens and Kings are valued at 10, and Aces can have a value of either 1 or 11. The Ace is always valued at 11 unless that would result in the hand going over 21, in which case it is valued as 1.

A starting hand of a 10 valued card and an Ace is called a Blackjack or natural and beats all hands other than another Blackjack. If both the player and dealer have Blackjack, the result is a push (tie): neither the player nor the bank wins and the bet is returned to the player.

A round is won if the sum of the cards in your hand are higher than the dealer and is still under 21. If not, the dealer wins the round. 

Also whoever that passes 21 loses the round.
